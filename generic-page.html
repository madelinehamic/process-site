											<h1>Research</h1>
											<p> This is my initial research.</p>
										</header>
										<h2>Primary Research</h2>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Equine_Rescue_Aiken_Home_Page.jpg" alt="Equine Website" /></span><h3>Research from the Equine Rescue Aiken</h3> One of the competitors of P.E.A.R.L., the website of Equine Rescue Aiken has a very accessible and clear home page.</p>
										<h5>Coordinating Services</h5>
										<p>The coalition provides their membership agencies services, share their resources, and work with the homeless population.</p>
										<h5>Advocacy</h5>
										<p>GCCH works with local officials, the community, and homeless people to ensure that the rights of homeless persons are preserved, that the trend of homelessness is reversed and that just social policy is enacted to end homelessness.</p>
										<h5>Education</h5>
										<p>GCCH provides groundwork for understanding the complexities of homelessness so that [Cincinnati] can work towards sustainable solutions.</p>
										<h5>Ways to Get Involved with GCCH</h5>
										<p>The site also featured information about how schools and churches can host "shantytowns", the coalition can provide speakers for a venue, and that they have a wish list of items that can be donated to help the cause.</p>
										<h5>Streetvibes</h5>
										<p>The Greater Cincinnati Homeless Coalition also has a newspaper called Streetvibes. The paper focuses on social justice issues and homelessness and features creative writing, poetry, articles, photography, and interviews written by homeless and formerly homeless individuals. The homeless can then sell the editions for two dollars to the public. They can then use this money as supplemental income. Some of their distributors can sell as many as 400 in a month.</p>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GCHC-16.png" alt="Shantytowns on the old website" /></span><h3>Shantytowns</h3>This was an interesting way that the coalition raises awareness of homelessness. A school or church can host a shantytown. This is basically when you gather a group of students or supporters to sleep outside, with a chaperone, to raise local awareness of the overwhelming numbers of people that sleep on the streets everyday.</p>
