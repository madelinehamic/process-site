											<h1>Research</h1>
											<p> Read on to discover the steps I took during the research process.</p>
										</header>
										<h2>Primary Research</h2>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Pearl Website.jpg" alt="PEARL Website" /></span></p>
										<h3>Research from the Palmetto Equine Awareness & Rescue League Website </h3>
										<p><h5>Organization Goal</h5> During the first stage of research, I determined the purpose and goals of the Palmetto Equine Awareness and Rescue League. The purpose of the P.E.A.R.L. Organization is to aid in the welfare and preservation of equine through education and direct rehabilitation. P.E.A.R.L. offers to accomplish this by providing educational seminars, aid to law enforcement and animal control during seizures, and rehabilitative services.</p>
 										<br><hr>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Pearl_case_webpage.jpg" alt="Scroll Down" /></span><h5>Purpose</h5>Solely funded through donations, P.E.A.R.L. "strives to eliminate abuse and neglect of equines by promoting responsible equine ownership through education and community awareness." P.E.A.R.L. works to rehabilitate abused and neglected equine to revitalize them for adoption or placement. To promote the health of equine, the organization also offers periodical gelding clinics.</p>

														<h3>Equine Rescue Aiken</h3>
														<p><h5>Accessible Home Page</h5> One of the competitors of P.E.A.R.L., the website of Equine Rescue Aiken has a very accessible and clear home page.</p>

Another useful feature is the inclusion of the call-to-action, "How Can You Help?"</p>

																		<h2>Secondary Research</h2>

																		<h3>Recent News</h3>
																	<p>To begin my secondary research, I gathered recent news and information regarding abused horses and equine rescues in order to gain knowledge of current practices and events.</p>
																		<!--<p>This article from the University of Cincinnati discusses the rising problem of Gentrification in Over-the-Rhine in downtown. This is a growing issue in Cincinnati as the city council and other corporations are kicking people out of their homes to build expensive condos and bring in wealthy class individuals. What is one to do if their rent keeps going up until they can no longer pay it or they are kicked out? The coalition advocates policy changes that prevent these sorts of incidents.</p>-->
																		<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Journal_Sentinel_Article.jpg" alt="Strategies to End Homelessness website" /></span> This article by the Journal Sentinel details the nationwide problem of equine abuse and neglect. </p>
																				<p>"It states, "Nationwide, more than 1 million horses have shipped to slaughter since 2007, according to the Equine Rescue Network. Of the estimated 9.2 million horses in the U.S., about 190,000 are considered unwanted."</p><br><br>
																		<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Journal_sentinel_Page_2.jpg" alt="Shelter and outreach page" /></span>Thanks to organizations like the ASPCA Equine Welfare Programs that create reward-backed challenges for equine rescues, thousands of equines have been adopted and millions of dollars have been donated. </p>
																				<br></br><br><br><br><br>
																				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Aiken_Equine_Rescue_Article.jpg" alt="Aiken Standard Article" /></span> Next, I researched the methods of successful equine rescue organizations. </p>
																						<p>The Equine Rescue of Aiken focuses on educating animal control officers in order to help them be knowledgeable in cases of equine seizure. They also emphasize the importance and helpfulness of implementing volunteers in the workforce of the rescue.</p><br><br>

																		<h3>Recent Innovations in Equine Rescue</h3>
																		<img class="image left" src="images/Fox News Article.jpg" alt="Fox News Article"/> In this stage of research, I discovered innovative ways to combat equine abuse and neglect.</p>
																		<p>This article by Fox News describes the widely successful "Help a Horse Home Adoption Challenge." The organization's website tells the purpose and impact of the challenge, stating, "Now in its sixth year, the ASPCAâ€™s annual Help a Horse initiative has been a meaningful way for equine rescues, shelters and sanctuaries to increase awareness for their lifesaving work to help at-risk horses by competing to win valuable grant funding and other resources." </p>
																		<p>By initiating this challege, it significantly raised awareness for the problem of abused and neglected equines, while setting an incentive for equine rescues to advance their amount of adoptions.</p>
																		<br><hr>

																		<h3>Solutions from Competitors</h3>
																		<p>In this section of research, I sought out websites of other equine rescues and organizations that used effective principles of design to help ease the use of the provided resources. </p>
																		<img class="image left" src="images/Equine_Rescue_Aiken_Home_Page.jpg" alt="Equine Rescue Aiken" />
																		<h4>Equine Rescue Aiken</h4>
																		<p><h5>Accessible Home Page</h5> One of the competitors of P.E.A.R.L., the website of Equine Rescue Aiken has a very accessible and clear home page. The bulk of the space on the home page is taken up by a large slider revolution that features crisp photos of horses at the rescue.  The text on the photo distinctly clarifies the purpose of the organization, and states the number of horses placed since 2006. The navigation bar at the top clearly displays the offered pages on the website. The volunteer button is very visible, emphasizing its importance.</p>
																		<br><hr>

																		<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Equine_Rescue_Aiken_Home_Scroll_Down.jpg" alt="Scroll Down" /></span><h5>Clear Call to Action</h5>When scrolling down the home page, the navigation bar floats with the scroll. Another useful feature is the inclusion of the call-to-action, "How Can You Help?" It then features the three most important actions for users of the site, "Adopt," "Donate," and "Volunteer." By placing these on the homepage, it creates a clear direction for the user and easy accessibility to the specified actions.</p>
																		<br><hr>

																		<img class="image left" src="images/AER Volunteer.jpg" alt="Volunteer Page" />
																		<p><h5>Simple Usability</h5> When clicking on the "Volunteer" page, it immediately shows an economized and clear organization of call-to-actions for the user. The minimality of the elements on the page helps economize the content, allowing the user to quickly find their destination.</p>
																		<br><br><br><hr>

																		<img class="image right" src="images/Adopt_Horses.jpg" alt="Adopt Horses" />
																		<h4>Adopt a Horse</h4>
																		<p><h5>Organized Box Elements</h5> The placement of these elements enables a clear and direct view of the horses up for adoption. This design strategy can immensely help increase adoptions by implementing high-quality photography with easy navigation.</p>
																		<br><hr>

																		<h3>Market Data</h3>
																		<img class="image left" src="images/Facebook Screenshot.jpg" alt="Facebook Screenshot" />
																		<p>The Palmetto Equine Awareness and Rescue League does not have a very broad marketing outreach. Along with the website, the only other marketing outlet in use is their Facebook account. The photos posted in the early years of the organization show raw, emotion-inducing photos of emaciated horses receiving care from the workers at the Palmetto Equine Awareness and Rescue League. These images can be highly impactful, and would elicit a emotional appeal from audiences if posted more often. The most current posts do not show any current events of the organization. This could cause the organization to appear inactive.
