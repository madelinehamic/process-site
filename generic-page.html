										<h2>Primary Research</h2>

										<h3>Research from the Palmetto Equine Awareness & Rescue League Website </h3>
										<p><h5>Organization Goal</h5> The purpose of the P.E.A.R.L. Organization is to aid in the welfare and preservation of equine through education and direct rehabilitation. P.E.A.R.L. offers to accomplish this by providing educational seminars, aid to law enforcement and animal control during seizures, and rehabilitative services.</p>
 										<br><hr>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Pearl_case_webpage.jpg" alt="Scroll Down" /></span><h5>Purpose</h5>Solely funded through donations, P.E.A.R.L. "strives to eliminate abuse and neglect of equines by promoting responsible equine ownership through education and community awareness." P.E.A.R.L. works to rehabilitate abused and neglected equine to revitalize them for adoption or placement. To promote the health of equine, the organization also offers periodical gelding clinics.</p>

																		<h3>Recent News</h3>
																		<!--<p>As the first part of my secondary research I decided to look at recent news in the Cincinnati area that might regard the homeless population.</p>
																			<p>This article from the University of Cincinnati discusses the rising problem of Gentrification in Over-the-Rhine in downtown. This is a growing issue in Cincinnati as the city council and other corporations are kicking people out of their homes to build expensive condos and bring in wealthy class individuals. What is one to do if their rent keeps going up until they can no longer pay it or they are kicked out? The coalition advocates policy changes that prevent these sorts of incidents.</p>-->
																		<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Journal_Sentinel_Article.jpg" alt="Strategies to End Homelessness website" /></span> Next, I researched ways to combat homelessness so that I could better understand the work that the coalition facilitates.</p>
																				<p>One of the member organizations of the GCCH is Strategies to End Homelessness. Not only does this site show a successful example of a homelessness organization website but it also has great information on, well, strategies to end homelessness.</p><br><br>
																		<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Journal_sentinel_Page_2.jpg" alt="Shelter and outreach page" /></span>Shelter and Outreach is one step to combat homelessness. This helped me to understand that reaching out and offering shelter is the first steps to solving the problem. The homeless population cannot do it on their own so services must be made known to them so that they can seek help in the right places.</p>
																				<p>This screen shot also talks about some of the improvements and successes of their shelters. So, this is the type of organization the coalition organizes with and advocates for.</p><br><br>

																		<h3>Recent Innovations in Equine Rescue</h3>
																		<img class="image left" src="images/Fox News Article.jpg" alt="Fox News Article" /> Next, I further explored the social media of the GCCH. I found that their Facebook seemed to be much more current in its use. They even feature a "Mona and Mark Show" where members of the coalition discuss social issues surrounding homelessness in Cincinnati. This video, pictured above, is one in which they discuss displacement. This was a new concept for me as well; I did not consider that the removal of benches, places to sit and rest, was a strategy to keep the homeless away from the city. It appears that there are deeper consequences to city planning and that something as simple as removing a bench can make a huge difference. Mona and Mark discuss how displacement is not the solution and can actually harm the community further.</p>
																		<p>Also they discuss current news in their Facebook. This is one instance where they are pointing out the injustices of homeless life and create a call to action for people to advocate a solution.</p>
																		<p>This is a web article form the coalition's Streetvibes paper. This piece discusses "Hostile Design" which is similar to displacement. It is city planners and builders purposefully changing the public space to be inhospitable to the homeless or even just people looking for a place to rest in the city.</p>
