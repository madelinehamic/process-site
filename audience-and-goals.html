						<h1>Determining the Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p>This stage of research focused on determining the target audience and various goals pertaining to the website.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>In order to determine the exact audience and goals of the organization, I implemented several research techniques. These methods helped specify the exact content and actions needed on the website.</p>
					<!-- The class called "row" is called so that we can use the column classes (4u, 8u, etc) in the divs inside. -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Audience.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>The first step that I took was to identify all of the primary groups of people who interact with the organization, identified by the purple sticky notes. These include individuals who work with P.E.A.R.L., such as veterinarians and law enforcement, and those who use their services, like adopters and equine owners. </p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Audience 2.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>The secondary groups of people are those who are related to the primary group, and thus are indirectly impacted by the organization, identified by the pink sticky notes.</p></div>
						<br></br>

						<!-- <div class="row">
						<h5>In Need of Services</h5>
						<br></br>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Adopters</li>
							<li>Horse Owners</li>
							<li>Animal Control</li>
							<li>Law Enforcement</li>
							<li>Make contact information clear to enable quick reporting of equine abuse</li>
							<li>Humane Society Chapters</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h5>Giving Services</h5>
						<br></br>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Donors</li>
							<li>Veterinarians</li>
							<li>Volunteers</li><hr>
						</ul>
					</div> -->

					<h4>Primary Audience Groups</h4>

						<div class="8u$"><p>Lastly, I divided the audience groups into either needing the services of P.E.A.R.L. or giving services to the organization. This enabled me to determine which groups of people were involved with those aspects of the operation. </p></div>

					<h2>Define Goals</h2>
					<p>By defining both the overarching and specific goals, it clarified the needed elements for the website.</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Client_Audience_Website.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>Next, I used the sticky note exercise to determine the goals of the client, audience, and website. Most goals were very similar, which helped determine the most crucial goals to focus on when redesiging the website.</p></div>

					<h3>Goals Conclusions</h3>
					<p>Based on this research, the primary goal of the Palmetto Equine Awareness and Rescue League is to provide rehalilitative resources to neglected and abused horses. In order to accomplish this goal, the organization primarily needs donations, volunteers, and by raising awareness. While the target audience has several different groups of people, it is primarily focused on accomplishing the goals of adopting, donating, volunteering, and learning pertinent information. The goals of the website are to clearly define important information, and attract donations, adoptions and volunteers. Most of these goals are very similar, which immensely helped me confirm the needed elements of the website.</p>

					<p>After reviewing the goals and practices stated on the PEARL website and gathering information from the audience research, I was able to determine the specific the specific goals. To aid in accomplishing these goals, the main design strategy I will implement is to organize and condense the information on the website. Clear navigation to call-to-action buttons will also aid in creating a more straightforward user experience.</p>

					<p>I am still awaiting replies from my client and respective users of the organization. As soon as they reply, I will interview them about their goals for using and implementing the website.</p>
