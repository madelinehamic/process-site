						<h1>Determining the Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p>This stage of research focused on determining the target audience and various goals pertaining to the website.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>In order to determine the exact audience and goals of the organization, I implemented several research techniques. These methods helped specify the exact content and actions needed on the website.</p>
					<!-- The class called "row" is called so that we can use the column classes (4u, 8u, etc) in the divs inside. -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Audience.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>The first step that I took was to identify all of the primary groups of people who interact with the organization, identified by the purple sticky notes. These include individuals who work with P.E.A.R.L., such as veterinarians and law enforcement, and those who use their services, like adopters and equine owners. </p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Audience 2.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>The secondary groups of people are those who are related to the primary group, and thus are indirectly impacted by the organization, identified by the pink sticky notes.</p></div>
						<br></br>
						<div class="row">
						<h5>In Need of Services</h5>
						<br></br>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Adopters</li>
							<li>Horse Owners</li>
							<li>Animal Control</li>
							<li>Law Enforcement</li>
							<li>Make contact information clear to enable quick reporting of equine abuse</li>
							<li>Humane Society Chapters</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h5>Giving Services</h5>
						<br></br>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Donors</li>
							<li>Veterinarians</li>
							<li>Volunteers</li><hr>
						</ul>
					</div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>Lastly, I divided the audience groups into either needing the services of P.E.A.R.L. or giving services to the organization. This enabled me to determine which groups of people were involved with those aspects of the operation. </p></div>
					</div>

					<h3>Goals Conclusions</h3>
					<p>As mentioned before the primary overarching goals of the GCCH is to eradicate homelessness through coordination of services, advocating policy change, and raising awareness and education of homelessness. The audience's goals are to access these services as well as to volunteer, sponsor the coalition, and donate. The website being the vehicle for these services online seeks to make education accessible, provide an outlet for coordinating services, and accrue members. I used my research of the website, the member org. website, and my audience exercise to determine these goals</p>

					<p>The specific goals and content are based on my interview with Dr. Mussman as well as the content that is currently on the GCCH website. The current GCCH website is in no short of content, if anything it has too much. The main work will be learning how to organize the information on the redesigned site so that it is clear and useful.</p>

					<p>Since I completed this assignment before my interviews, I adjusted a couple things so that the goals would portray the true goals of the coalition. I managed to assume correctly that schools, students, and churches were the coalitions top audiences. However, I had to change the content to consider that the coalition does not offer volunteering. So there still will be a volunteering tab but it will instead give info on how to work through the coalition in order to contribute. This new version of my goals also has more specified information. For example, I specified that if someone in the audience wants to sponsor then they would sponsor a shantytown or an edition of the Streetvibes paper.</p>
