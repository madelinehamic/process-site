					<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
					<p>First, we started with determining the design challenge. This is a worksheet from the Human Centered Design Toolkit helps frame the challenge as an actionable question.</p>
				</header>

				<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
					<p>To provide rehabilitation resources for abused and neglected horses in South Carolina. </p>
					<h3>1.Frame it as a design challenge.</h3>
					<p>How can the website provide clear instructions and resources for people with abused horses?</p>
					<h3>2.	State the ultimate impact you’re trying to have.</h3>
					<p>Provide treatment and rehabilitation for horses that were abused or neglected in the upper South Carolina area. </p>
					<h3>3.	What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
					<p>Create a website that has clear and easy-to-follow navigation, with visual hierarchy and high-quality images. The information on the website is very heavy, so it would be beneficial to minimize the amount of text in each area of the website. Increasing the white space to create effective focal points and organizing the elements of the webpages will be helpful as well. </p>
					<h3>4.	Write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing.</h3>
					<p>The organization is very small and does not have solidified branding or an updated marketing plan and outreach. </p>
					<h3>5.	Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
					<p>How can the website provide an appealing and clear navigation of services for individuals seeking equine rehabilitation services?  </p>
					<hr>
					<p>These questions helped me rethink and rephrase the design problem.</p>
					<p>Revised question: <strong>How can the website provide an appealing and clear navigation of services for individuals seeking equine rehabilitation services?</strong></p>
