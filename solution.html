					<h1>Solution</h1>
					<p>The last step of the process was to create a visual solution. This included a Call to Action and Style Tile. </p>
				</header>
				<h2>Call to action</h2>
				<div class="row 50% uniform">
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Updated_Call_to_Action.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
					<div class="12u$"><p>For my Call to Action, I settled on “We Provide Healing. You Prevent Abuse. Save a Horse.” I incorporated this direct and demanding tone of voice to emphasize the seriousness of the situation of horse neglect and P.E.A.R.L.’s purpose. “We Provide Healing.” conveys the primary purpose of P.E.A.R.L., which is to rehabilitate abused and neglected horses. “You Prevent Abuse.” focuses on the user’s ability to stop horse abuse through their actions and knowledge. “Save a Horse” is purposely broad. By not making it specific, the button could lead to a page that includes all of the ways a user could help, such as donating, volunteering, or adopting a horse.

					</p><p>This Call to Action directly fulfills the goals of P.E.A.R.L. by creating awareness of the organization and an emphasis on the user’s need to provide resources.
					</p></div>
				</div>

				<h2>Style Tile</h2>
				<div class="row 50% uniform">
					<div class="12u1"><p>To fully encompass the solution to the design challenge, I created a Style Tile. This incorporated the Call to Action, colors, and typefaces that were consistent with the goals and character of P.E.A.R.L.</p></div>
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Updated_Style_Tile_Landscape-01-01-01-01.jpg" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" /></span></div>
					<div class="12u$"><p>When designing my Style Tile, I kept the following adjectives in mind, dedicated, caring, educational, kind, restorative, active, healthful, and resourceful. These adjectives accurately describe the purpose, goals, and character of the Palmetto Equine Awareness and Rescue League, which I gathered from my interviews and other research. As for the website’s typefaces, I chose the family of Roboto because of its modern sans serif characteristics that embody the approachability and accessibility of P.E.A.R.L. Headers are Bold Roboto, subheads are Italic Roboto, and the body copy is in Roboto Regular.
					</p><p>
						To convey the characteristics of P.E.A.R.L., I incorporated three colors. The gray hue establishes the strong dedication of the organization. In a different way, the light blue color represents the healing and caring aspects of P.E.A.R.L. Lastly, the coral red color acts as a focal point and represents the constant action of the equine rescue.
					</p><p>
						The ‘Adopt a Horse’ buttons show an example of the organization of the elements on the Adoption page. Similar to my research of horse adoption sites, I included headshots of the featured horses along with their names. This placement evokes an approachable and easy-to-navigate organization that users could easily be attracted to.
